Notes:
1. Please do not remove my credits as I have worked on this to get a functional loadout system for arma 3 servers.

2. This is a old script file I created when I was developing for the Arma community, you may use this code for your needs.

///////////////////////////////////////

Instructions to setup:

1. Drag the Xynous_Loadout_System.sqf file into the mission file.

2. Execute and initilize the script using the mission pbo init file like so: execVM "Path\To\Xynous_Loadout_System.sqf";

3. Edit the the item classnames to suit your players loadout needs and add the players UID to either the Tier1Loadout, Tier2Loadout, Tier3Loadout

4. Players should now have their loadout class on respawn.
